Hi, I’m @Cornelius-Wang

I’m interested in technology that enables developers to create and automate experiences for end-users.

I advise and collaborate on Seed / Pre-seed ideas, with an emphasis in cannabis supply-chain projects. Mainly through the Founder Institute San Francisco chapter.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Vue/Swift, familiar with JS/React/Java/SQL

- ☁ familiar with Digital Ocean, GCP, AWS.
